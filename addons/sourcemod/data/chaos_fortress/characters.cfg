//This basic characters.cfg template outlines how to add or remove characters to or from character packs, as well as how to create character packs and determine which packs are active.
//In this example, The "Default" character pack is enabled, while the "Example Download Pack" character pack is disabled.
//Despite being disabled, "Example Download Pack" characters still get their files downloaded.
